## Requirements
* PyCharm
* PyTorch
* Python
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Introduction
This project used PyTorch to build a CNN model to recognize all types of cells that are present in the given images. These cell types are: red blood cell, difficult, gametocyte, trophozoite, ring, schizont, and leukocyte. The best model over the past seven-day data challenge competition yielded a loss score of 4.54085.
